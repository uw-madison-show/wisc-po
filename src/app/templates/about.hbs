  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <hr/>

  <p>The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) is a statewide public health survey
    designed to help improve health in Wisconsin and throughout the world. The
    program has been in operation by the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine
    and Public Health since 2008. Over 3,500 Wisconsin residents have joined.
    SHOW is funded by the Wisconsin Partnership Program.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin is designed to:
    <ul>
      <li>To conduct annual health surveys of Wisconsin residents and communities</li>
      <li>To conduct longitudinal follow-up of survey participants</li>
      <li>Enable community-specific and community-driven ancillary studies</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) is the first statewide research
    survey of its kind to measure information on critical health conditions in
    Wisconsin. The data that SHOW collects is shared with leaders, organizations
    and researchers who use it to improve health in the state. Findings from SHOW
    present a comprehensive picture of the health of Wisconsin residents, helping
    to identify needs and target resources where they are most needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin is under the direction of Dr. F. Javier
    Nieto and his team at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and
    Public Health. The SHOW team includes experts in survey research from the UW
    department of Population Health Sciences and benefits from the scientific
    advice of a broad range of experts and consultants from multiple departments
    at UW, the state, and around the nation.
  </p>

  <p>
    SHOW is modeled after the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) national survey
    (NHANES), which has provided key health information about the nation's health
    for 35 years. With state focus, SHOW provides the more detailed information
    needed to understand the unique health needs in Wisconsin.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each year, trained Survey of the Health of Wisconsin staff knock on the doors
    of randomly selected households throughout the state to invite people to
    participate. All participation in SHOW is voluntary. SHOW will meet face-to-face
    and privately with up to 1,000 Wisconsin residents to evaluate their health.
    Because the participants in the survey are selected as a representative sample
    of the state populations, the results of these surveys tell us about the health
    of all Wisconsin residents.
  </p>

  <p>
    Survey of the Health of WisconsinSHOW uses a variety of health assessments
    methods to capture information not available before about the health of
    Wisconsin residents. These assessments include: in-person interviews, paper
    questionnaires, computer-assisted surveys, physical measurements and laboratory
    tests.
  </p>

  <p>
    SHOW measures a broad range of health information. These include many conditions
    and health-related characteristics that, to date, have only been measured by
    self-report. These conditions include high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
    Additionally, the use of computer-assisted questionnaires provide previously
    unavailable information about nutrition and exercise habits, access to health
    care, health care use and other health related behaviors.
  </p>

  <p>
    All the information collected by the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin its
    confidential. SHOW publishes results in summarized fashion, but no data on
    individual survey participants will be released or given away to any outside
    party. With the study participant's permission, the information will be available
    to qualified researchers well into the future and will be used to monitor the health
    of Wisconsin communities and to design programs that improve the health of
    residents.

  <h1>About Our Data</h1>
  <hr/>

  <p>
    In order to more fully understand our data we are currently working on explaining
    what each of our indicators represents. <a href="#">Here</a> is what we have
    so far.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should keep in mind that each county and region will have different sample sizes, and therefore the confidence intervals are different.
